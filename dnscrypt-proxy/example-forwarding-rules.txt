#        Forwarding rules        #
##################################

## This is used to route specific domain names to specific servers.
## The general format is:
## <domain> <server address>[:port] [, <server address>[:port]...]
## IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in square brackets.

## In order to enable this feature, the "forwarding_rules" property needs to
## be set to this file name inside the main configuration file.

## Blocking IPv6 may prevent local devices from being discovered.
## If this happens, set `block_ipv6` to `false` in the main config file.

## Forward *.lan, *.local, *.home, *.internal and *.localdomain to 192.168.1.1
lan               10.0.0.254
local             10.0.0.254
home              10.0.0.254
internal          10.0.0.254
localdomain       10.0.0.254

## Forward queries for example.com and *.example.com to 9.9.9.9 and 8.8.8.8
# example.com     9.9.9.9,8.8.8.8
